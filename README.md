# p5js-projects
Here I present some games and physics visualizations using the p5.js library. See the details of the library in their reference page, [here](https://p5js.org/reference/). 

These projects serve the purpose of practicing what I'm learning about Object Oriented Programming. I am learning Computer Science through some courses online (mainly CS50 at Harvard) and practising that knowledge with the development of classic games in p5js. I am also following the turorials and coding challenges of Daniel Shifman [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA).

The projects that I have in a more advanced state of development are:

#### sort-algorithms
This project implements the visualization of some of the most common sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort and merge sort. The user can select one of the algorithms, give him/herself a random new array of integer numbers and click play to view how each algorithm sorts the array of values.

#### minesweeper
The classic Minesweeper game. I am following the  design choice in the Windows 95 version, which I have old memories associated with. I still have some work to do in getting the interface to be as similar as the one presented in Windows 95, but the game works well. It has some peculiar algorithms like *flood fill*, which has to be called when the player hits a square with no number nor mine in it. It was very fun learning about these algorithms.

#### snake
The classic snake game has been developed and also has some minor visual aspects to be fixed. 

#### tetris
I am currently following the design decisions of the Nintendo NES version of Tetris, that was released in 1984 and I want it to have that retro style, with information displayed in *pixel art* style.
